## Abstract

I study in Beijing Institute of Technology for my bachelor's degree and master's degree. I majored in computer science. These are some of the assignments that my team and I completed during school.
I sincerely hope that these resources can be helpful for you in your homework, but I also hope that you make them "just for reference". Wish you success in your studies!
